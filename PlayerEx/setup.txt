Alright so you want to color things?
First of all you will require chrome since I have not yet implemented Firefox etc. (didn't even check if this will be possible)
launch chrome and open the site chrome://extensions
there you should see a list of all current extensions. on the top right enable dev mode
Then a couple buttons should appear.
Press the button add unpackaged Extension and select the extension folder.
to reload player use f5
to apply changes use -updateBrowser
