Alright so you want to color things?
First of all you will require chrome since I have not yet implemented Firefox etc. (didn't even check if this will be possible)
launch chrome and open the site chrome://extensions
there you should see a list of all current extensions. on the top right enable dev mode
Then a couple buttons should appear.
Press the button add unpackaged Extension and select the Intermediate folder.
This will only be possible if you already generated the extension data once using the command -updateBrowser
after each time you update the extension you will have to reload both the extension and player.
to reload the extension use crtl+r
to reload player use f5
